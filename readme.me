After completing the Odin Project I am hoping to be competant enough with programming that I can comfortably take on my first uncomfortable project.
By this, I mean that I don't expect to know everything, but I expect to know how to figure it out.

First project ideas:
- Personal website
- Website with interactive game where you play as Scooby trying to catch a fish
- Website to track local politics in Brunswick/New Hanover Counties
